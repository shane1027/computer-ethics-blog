## From your experience, what are the most important parts of the guide your group constructed? What do you know now that you wished you new earlier? What is the best advice or guidance you've received?

Reaching out to professors and not being stressed out about interviews are the
two most important parts of the guide created.  Both of these tools have given
rise to my successful internship experiences thus far.  Professors frequently
have contacts in industry and academia who can give students a different
perspective on work outside of school in order to help better discern their
career path.  Also, recommendations from professors who have strong ties to
your field will carry much more weight in an application, and in some cases can
help get your foot in the door for a first interview or job opportunity.

I wish someone had told me earlier to jump on the career search process early
on.  The beginning of the Fall semester sophomore year is a chance for students
to get ahead and connect with recruiters early - also, simply undergoing the
process for the first time will give you a much better insight into how to find
employment come Junior and Senior year.

The best advice I've ever received didn't have much to do with career
search at the time, but upon reflection, it has everything to do with the
process of career and personal development: "Don't settle for 99% when you're
capable of getting 100%"  Applying this to career search means you should
always apply to 'reach' companies and internships, working to push yourself in
your field, until you have found something in which you thrive.


## College traditionally has been viewed as a place of learning, not necessarily job training and yet students are spending more and more time preparing for the job interview process. Should colleges adjust their curriculum to face this reality?

This depends on the definition of college - trade schools have existed for a
long time, and perhaps it's time there were more refined 'Code Academies'
geared towards thorough preparation of the trade of certain computer
programming disciplines.  I don't believe colleges should adjust their
coursework to explicitly add more coverage to the interview process, but
mandating participation in clubs or applied group work in a more centralized
way may help this indirectly.  A University like Notre Dame is still a liberal
arts school that aims to give a holistic education beyond just knowledge needed
for success in a specific job or discipline.

## If so, how would you change the ND CSE program to better prepare students for the workforce?

I don't have much experience with the CSE program here at Notre Dame, but have
friends in computer science who voice their interest in having more 'practical'
class work.  Specifically, classes like Operating Systems and Logic Design come
to mind.   I took Logic Design and enjoyed it as an Electrical Engineer, and
haven't taken Operating Systems, so I can't comment on that.

## If not, discuss why you don't think changes are needed and how the ND CSE program already supports students.

One thing I can speak for is the Computer Science Department's apparent ability
and willingness to support students of a diverse background and interest -
teachers frequently provide a welcoming environment and I always feel
comfortable asking for extra help or clarification as they are quite
approachable.
