Widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars would revolutionize the
efficiency of many industries: trucking, ride-sharing forms of transportation,
and delivery services to name a few.  Motivation for pursuing this seems
largely monetary, as are most of the applications of new technologies in a commercial
manner, but government and regulators may also embrace the added simplicity and
convenience that reliable self-driving vehicles will bring to their
communities.  Most all of the arguments in favor of self-driving vehicles
include an increase in road awareness per vehicle and therefore in road safety,
improved convenience and efficiency, and a movement toward a more automated
future.  However, there are significant obstacles yet to be overcome in the
field, such as the qualms of displacing employed truck drivers and taxi
drivers, delivery men and women, and offloading the decision-making process
during life-or-death situations to a piece of code.  In reality, once the
technology is sufficiently refined, these vehicles will make our roads much,
much safer.  When a Tesla crashed and had battery difficulty, drawing negative
press towards Elon Musk's company and the industry in general, Musk replied
saying their Autopilot feature was 38 percent safer than normal driving
conditions, statistically speaking.  This is to be expected as these vehicles
share each other's driving experience and have hundreds of millions of miles of
driver training to date.

One of the largest moral dilemmas in the self-driving industry is how to
optimize dangerous situations in real time.  According to [this Gizmodo
article][gizmodo], people agree that utilitarian approaches to safety are the
best way to remedy the situation.  If a car is rocketing towards a group of 10
pedestrians, naturally it should swerve off of the road, even if that endangers
the lone passenger, because 1 is fewer than 10!  But when faced with the
concept of *being* the lone passenger in the vehicle, placing one's life in the
hands of a computer controlled algorithm became a less popular sentiment.  In
my opinion, some sort of happy medium should be reached that balances the
dangers faced by both parties.  The test cases presented to form these ethical
arguments are just that - ideal test cases.  Yes, a car can swerve to avoid
passengers, but that doesn't guarantee it will ram into a concrete barrier and
kill all of its passengers.  In fact, self-driving cars such as the Tesla have
incredible safety ratings and have even been cited as having ["the lowest ever
probability of injury of any car ever tested by NHTSA."][tesla_safety]  So as
technology advances, so should safety.  

But say there truly is a black-and-white, life-or-death, them-or-me situation
that your self-driving car ends up facing.  Yes, this is a tough question to
tackle.... But maybe there should be contextual considerations.  Did the car
make a mistake, running a red light or speeding, failing to recognize some sort
of traffic control sign?  In that case, the car should take the blame and
swerve off, even at the expense of the owner, considering the pedestrians have
done no wrong.  In the event that the car strikes the pedestrians, it seems
reasonable to hold the company liable, and in the event the driver is killed in
a crash that occurred due to missed information by the vehicle, it also seems
reasonable to hold the company liable.  However, this should only be the case
if there is some sort of bug or issue that has been known to be problematic and
potentially dangerous that has not been addressed by the company (think
Ford Pinto gas tank danger, or the Mustang II exploding when being
rear-ended).  In order for this to be effective, there must be a regulating
body that sets self-driving standards just as there are for crash test
standards.  Should cars meet these rigorous standards and unknowingly have
an issue that leads to malfunction and danger, that should not be on the
company, unless it can be proven that neglect of some sort was involved.

If the vehicle is not at fault in the situation, such as a group of people
running across a highway or sidewalk against the traffic signal, it should do
all it can to optimize the situation (slam on brakes in a controlled fashion,
maybe change lanes if it is safe, etc.), but it should put it's passengers
first.  This situation would not be unlike how a normal drive would react, plus
the self-driving car could immediately notify emergency services and alert
fellow self-driving vehicles of the road blockage or potential danger.  In this
case, the pedestrians crossing against the signal should be held liable for
damages.

Socially, self-driving cars will be an improvement to our communities.
Elimination of drunk-driving, which kills [almost 10,000 people
annually][drunk_driving]; optimized ride-sharing services such as Uber and
Lyft, making such services more affordable than ever; and increased safety in
the sense of road safety and the option to escape harmful situations by
summoning a self-driving car service.  Politically, I don't know how different
places will respond, but considering the resistance Uber faced in places like
France and Portland, there will likely be a long adjustment period.  Regulation
should come in the form of a safety commission that, as previously stated, acts
to set a very high standard for the implementation of self-driving vehicles.
This way liability can be well-defined for malfunctions and accidents, and
road safety can remain a priority in a rapidly growing industry.

I would love a self-driving vehicle.  In fact, I've been looking into
open-source projects that involve retrofitting vehicles to drive themselves,
and am tempted to get involved in such a project :)
