Two fellow classmates and I have drafted what we believe to be a worthy list of
guidelines to be a successful and ethical member of computer science and
engineering:

Code of Ethics
--------------

1.  Discover and disseminate knowledge and truth for its own sake.
    - Publish knowledge that is unpublished
    -  Make all code that can effectively be open source, open source
    - Build things with the purpose of disseminating knowledge and truth
        * Properly document
2.  Do work with a purpose
    - Do not sell out your abilities to the highest bidder.
    - Commit to work you are passionate about.
    - Pro bono work
3.  Do not engineer products for the purposes of deception, grievance, nuisance
i.e. "trolling". 
    - Do not engineer products that have undesired functionality beyond the
expectations of the end user.
    - Do not engineer products that are meant to inflict emotional pain on others.
4.  Formulate a positive image for the community
    - When acting as an engineer, broadcast your intentions and allow others to
 understand your goals
    - Work to communicate effectively with people of varying levels of experience.
    - Do not try to impress with complex language  (i.e. acting like a wizard)
        * Respect the muggle population.
5.  Utilize the tools that you have; do not waste opportunity.
6.  Be thorough in constructing safe and secure products
    - Build secure things in the context of things that can't be attacked by humans
    - Build safe things in the context of things that act like theyâ€™re supposed to
7.  Be honest and promote honesty
    - Help create an environment in which people feel comfortable being honest with each other
    - Seek and accept honest criticism of work
8.  Respect privacy
    - Handle sensitive data with care and respect
9.  Demonstrate exemplary student behavior
    - Understand the things you build
    - Be honest about contributions 
    - Complete tasks with the goal of learning
10. Respect property rights of individuals and organizations
    - Abide by copyright rules
    - Do not infringe on patents
    - Use given resources responsibly
11. Treat others fairly and judge based on merit



Ultimately, this list serves as an outline of the most important aspects of
ethical application of our abilities, some of which we have discussed in class
thus far.  While it is not comprehensive, it certainly has more relevant and
specific points compared to a few of the example Codes of Ethics, and is more
practical to follow as a student or recent graduate.  The underlying theme is
collaboration and working toward a common goal or success rather than
developing with the purpose of exploitation or domination.

One weakness of this document is the perceived lack of encouragement for
competition, or the potential interpretation of discouraging it completely.  This is in no way discouraging competition, which is ethical and necessary when
applied in a healthy manner.  We understand that competition drives innovation
and draws out the best in creators and end-users alike, so we seek to use these
guidelines to manage competition and not let it consume our work.  In this way,
we will create with the perspective of a Notre Dame education, understanding
our obligation to capitalize on our opportunities.

A Code of Ethics can certainly be useful when all members of an organization
are operating with a dedication to that Code.  I think that at an individual
level it is difficult to always interpret such a Code correctly or feel
obligated to following an objectively arbitrary extra set of rules - however,
when a group or company is committed to such ideals, that community may very
well be better off for it and rally around its purpose.  Either way, this was
still a valuable exercise!
