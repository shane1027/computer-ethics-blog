The root cause of the Challenger disaster was a broken decision making process
with unnatural and irresponsible priorities.  Although the mechanical failure
of the O-ring sealing a fuel tank (the physical root cause of the explosion),
the reprehensible refutation of engineers' concerns over the issue is what
killed those seven people.

After reading over the tables and graphics given to management as evidence of
such concern, I do agree that those voicing such concerns could have done so in
a much clearer manner - such as the charts displayed during the Rogers
Commission.  However, one comment really stuck out to me as displaying the
absolute ignorance and neglect from management:  The engineers were told the
night before launch that they must prove, with data, without a doubt, that the
O-rings would fail in cold conditions.  *What kind of garbage is that?*  The
space industry had millions of dollars of equipment, a reputation, and human
lives on the line, and yet they were not interested in proving without a doubt
that the Challenger was ready for flight.  Rather, they would only delay the
flight if a possible threat could be proven viable without a doubt....
Incredibly backwards logic for people who should be competent enough to hold
such management positions at a place like NASA.

Yes, Roger Boisjoly was absolutely correct in sharing the information on the
preventable disaster with the public, just as he was correct in voicing his
concerns prior to the launch to his superiors, and correct in not signing off
on the engineer's green light paperwork.  Many of the arguments we've had about
whistleblowing include pointing out the fact that many other veins of
communication are a better option for voicing concerns - talking to
supervisors, co-workers, management, or even resorting to third-party
regulating bodies in extreme cases.  These options should be exhausted if one
is truly aiming for healthy change in an organization.  Well, Roger did that
and more prior to the launch, and although I can't find the article anymore, I
once read that he hadn't forgiven himself to this day that he hadn't done more
to stop the launch, including running out onto the damn launchpad.  This man
was truly committed to being an ethical engineer and human being.  And
considering NASA and related companies dodged the O-ring issue during the
beginning of the investigation, I'm incredibly thankful that Roger brought the
information to light somehow.  When fallback systems become the default and
management won't listen to the concerns of a highly-competent group of people
directly involved in the risk-management of a task, something must be done.

I don't think Thiokol is justified in tormenting Boisjoly's career after he
testified under the Roger Commission, but at the same time I've come to expect
that from a company who's 'dirty laundry' is aired by a trusted individual.
But this is more than a money-making scandal or a hostile work environment -
this was an incredibly flawed decision making process leading to the loss of
human life and national embarrassment.  And to Roger - what good is
whistleblowing if it ruined your career?  It ensures the mistakes are addressed
under no uncertain terms, pressures companies involved to restructure the
failed processes thus avoiding the potential loss of human life again, and
gives courage to those facing a green light sign-off sheet to stand
up for themselves and for others and not sign when necessary.
