Some form of a Code of Conduct is certainly necessary for companies,
organizations, and communities in the tech world.  We have seen the
under-representation of females in Computer Science due to a systematically
masculine culture, misappropriation of salaries towards whites rather than
rewarding the merit of all races, and how even large companies such as Google
and Facebook still have a long way to go in the move towards an equal
workplace.  Thus, it seems imperative that a set of regulations in regards to
conduct be thrust upon members of a community or company in order to ensure a
welcoming and progressive environment is maintained.

While adherence to a code of conduct may not be necessary for legal compliance
for a group or organization, the use of such a tool is an explicit nod towards
the amount of import a company places on the conversation of equality.  Jesse
Noller said it best on the Python Code of conduct:  **Explicit is better than
implicit.**   Although a company or group may have good intentions or foster a
welcoming environment, having a written set of standards helps reinforce that
to the outside world and to internal members.  Computer science should be a
field of low barriers to entry and inclusion for all that are interested - this
is one possible such improvement in the field.  And as long as an organization
commits to upholding the values and rules specified, these codes are *not*
merely another form of political correctness.  They serve to make it abundantly
clear that there is no tolerance for discrimination, sexual harassment,
exclusion, or any similar means of improper conduct.  This brings structure to
an environment and provides steadfast expectations of how to judge conduct in
various situations.

Most of the Codes of Conduct listed in the reading have common themes:
Welcoming others, building a supportive environment through respectful
interactions, and striving to understand differences rather than allow them to
separate members.  These all seem to be noble and reasonable goals to me.
However, after reading Linus Torvald's opinion on workplace pleasantries and
implementing a Code of Conduct, I see the issues that can come along with
having one in place.  However, Linus' situation is unique - the long-standing
Finnish profanity is less a personal attack on the recipients of his harsh
language and more of an airing of genuine feelings and some cultural
disconnect.  Linus seems to carry a jaded opinion on corporate "professional"
practices as he cites the idea that the same emotions are manifest in unnatural
ways in such systems rather than being delivered upfront.  This may be a
problem in certain groups, but ultimately a proper Code of Conduct would ensure
such wrong-doing would not occur.  Perhaps, to help remedy the situation, a
Code of Conduct should also mandate giving and receiving positive criticisms
where they are due.

The discussion of Codes of Conduct seems to cross boundaries defined by merit
according to the article about the Ruby community and the discussion of intent
to offend.  If this field is truly
pushing for equality and inclusion, then why should someone's opinions or minor
interactions off the job dictate whether or not they are welcome to participate
in a project on the job?  This seems to run counter to the idea that one should
be included and compensated based on merit.  Although in extreme cases
off-the-job actions may dictate necessary removal from on-the-job
associations, vocalizing opinions online or using harsh or critical phrases
when reviewing work should not qualify.

For the Douglas Crockford situation:  I find it absolutely absurd that he was
removed as a speaker...  the guy did nothing wrong during the presentation and
made one cavalier remark to another presenter behind the stage...  Had she
spoken up adequately, perhaps he'd have apologized or at least understood how
the listener felt.  Although the LambaConf speaker legitimately held
racist / sexist views, if he was not articulating such views at the conference
or allowing them to influence his technical contributions to functional
programming, he should technically be allowed to speak as well, although this
is a much more drastic case.
