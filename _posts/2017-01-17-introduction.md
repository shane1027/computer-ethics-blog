Hi there!  My name is Shane Ryan - I'm a Junior at the University of Notre Dame
studying Electrical Engineering and Physics.  While these two fields are my
main areas of study, I frequently explore the world of Computer Science outside
of the classroom while tinkering with, breaking, and rebuilding anything I can
get my hands on.

My interest in these fields stems from the realization that their advances in
the last few decades are the underpinnings of today's Information Age society.  Working to understand these disciplines in context of one another and through the
perspective of a Notre Dame education has ignited a passion within me for learning more and seeking to contribute. 

My hobbies include working on my old Jeep and vintage Vespa Grande moped(both of which were junkyard finds); tinkering with electromechanical and embedded systems such as Keurigs, washers / dryers, video game consoles, lighting displays and more; taking on side projects rooted in computer science, especially linux related and geared towards reverse-engineering; playing acoustic guitar, basketball, and other activities with friends.

I have long wrestled with the moral implications of studying and creating new
technologies, especially ones whose impact on daily life outpaces our ability
to explore and test long-term consequences.  From drone strikes to hand-held,
ever-present social media, the world is a drastically different place for
recent generations compared to our technologically humble roots.  I seek to
understand the roles I can fill in society and how an ethical approach to my
career and application of skills can be achieved.

Some of the most pressing ethical and moral Computer Science issues that I am aware of are responsible data
management (especially large-scale, sensitive data), use of cyber-warfare and
surveillance, whistle-blowing, automation influencing blue collar jobs and a disposable society,
machine learning and neural networks making decisions, and piracy.  I plan on
exploring many different facets of Computer Science throughout my career and
am genuinely interested in all of these issues and their implications.
