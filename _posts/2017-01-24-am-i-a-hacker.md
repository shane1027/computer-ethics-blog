*Hackers* - those crazy nerds that type commands into an old-fashioned looking
computer prompt with a green hue, aiming to gain access to everyone's computer
systems and reach havoc upon the regular world.  Right?  Well, at least that's
what comes to mind when I think of Hollywood's opinion of a hacker.

In the above sense, no, I am not really a hacker.  Yes I've used [aircrack-ng][aircrack]
on Kali Linux to sniff and crack WEP three-way handshakes before; implemented
man-in-the-middle attacks on friends internet networks to
mess with their Facebook login cookies and post funny things or boot them off
the network... but all of this
was done with an explanation to and (reluctant) consent from the affected party, for the sake of technical interest, not exploitation.  One software-based project that may fall in the gray area of the definition of a hacker is the circumvention of a key-based authentication system for a deprecated 2D civil engineering analysis tool due to a lack of verification servers from the creators after they went out of business.  But for the most part, I do not spend my time attempting to bring down the free world or 'fight the man' by hacking.

My interpretation of the term 'hacker' is someone who creatively repurposes
available resources to accomplish a task, especially for solving a technical
problem - and by this definition I am a proud hacker indeed!  For example,
growing up I received a non-running 1979 Vespa Grande moped from the junkyard for 
my 16th birthday.  Due to a lack of tools, money, and other resources, I had to
implement quite a bit of creative problem-solving in order to fix up the
machine.  For instance, I used a dremel to cut out slots in the variator,
allowing the roller weights driving the transmission to fly further out and
function correctly with my available setup as opposed to spending money on a
new one.  After rebuilding the top end of the engine, no head gasket was
available for an engine of this age, so I cut apart an aluminum can to make a
new gasket, using the old one as a template.  The condenser was blown and I
built my own using capacitors.  More recently, after spinning a rod bearing on my junkyard Jeep, I
ordered an engine from a completely different decade and model vehicle from a
junkyard via eBay and made major modifications to get it to function in my
vehicle.  All of these jenky fixes qualify as 'hacking' in my book!


This sort of hacking can also be implemented in a computer science /
engineering way - for my Intro to Computing final project last year, I
disassembled an early model Keurig, traced various electronic signals through
the PCB holding buttons that the user manipulates, and added my own
microcontroller to manipulate said signals.  Then, connecting a Raspberry Pi
running Arch Linux to the UART system in the microcontroller, I was able to
schedule when my Keurig makes coffee and force the start of a brew from
anywhere in the world using SSH.  After an Embedded Systems course last year, I
was able to tap into and decode communications in the dorm laundry network and
join the conversation.  Although I did not do anything unethical using this, I
could control the laundry network at will (I have the on-campus laundry
service, and thus no need to actually use the machines in the dorm.  I was just
curious).

Mark Zuckerberg's idea of ["The Hacker Way"][hackerway] is certainly a description I would
fall under - "The Hacker Way is an approach to building that involves
continuous improvement and iteration. Hackers believe that something can always
be better, and that nothing is ever complete. They just have to go fix it —
often in the face of people who say it’s impossible or are content with the
status quo."  This is an awesome articulation of a mantra I've followed my
entire life without knowing it as the hacker way - it's just my natural approach 
to problem-solving.  This fosters a culture of action and merit.  Get things
done, and may the best idea / implementation win!
