**Ethics:** *Moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting
of an activity; syn: moral code, morals, rights and wrongs, principles,
value system.*

Computer Science is a fast-paced field that is revolutionized
every decade.  Since the turn of the last century, it's also become the glue that holds
our society together - from medical data to the influence of online media, the field is
all-encompassing and here to stay. Why *wouldn't* one study ethics in the
context of such a critical and young field?

Ethics in the field of Computer Science is not just a conversation on ideas of
open-source software or copyright laws - while both are important issues,
greater ones in my opinion include the responsible use of big data, automation
advances that supplement workers rather than replace them, or the responsible
use of the trust that all end-users place in software developers, especially
for those involved with communications and the exchange of private information.

In the words of Dr. Ben Adida, a graduate of the Cryptography and Information
Security group at MIT, ["Everyone uses software, very few people understand it."][benlog]  Even incredibly intelligent people who are not familiar with the world of computer science or concepts of networking and security are placing blind faith in developers upon using electronic platforms involving personal data or other sensitive information.
And this blind trust expands greatly with every step forward into this growing
society of technology.  As Uncle Ben says to the young Peter Parker - With
great power comes great responsibility.  Ethics should be at the forefront of
the field of Computer Science in order to focus efforts towards building
and implementing software with long-term impact in mind.  Engineering ethics
is, at it's core, the safe-keeping of public welfare, and software has an
enormous role in this conversation.

More mature fields of engineering have [grown ethical codes and standards of
operation into formal law][engineering_ethics] due to their increasingly direct impact on society.
The early days of industrialization and beginnings of engineering were rife
with catastrophes and hazardous failures of various scales.  A 'good' or
'well-intentioned' engineer was the only thing preventing such failures from
harming an end user.  Engineers developed codes of ethics and various standards
in order to succeed at delivering safe, effective systems to the public, and as
these systems became widespread, our government turned these ethics and standards
into law.

The youth of computer science lends me to believe that this responsibility of
the safe-keeping of the public's welfare still falls upon individual engineers
to a large extent.  Codes of ethics and performance or reliability standards
are still young, and eventually should be consolidated into clear-cut laws for
the benefit of the public.  And no matter how 'good' or 'ethical' a developer
may be it should be remembered that being competent, thorough, and committed
does more good for the reliability of the end product.
