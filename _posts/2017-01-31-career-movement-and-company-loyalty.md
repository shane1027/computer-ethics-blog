I honestly have no clear idea of where my career is headed - my interests are
varied, and I'm blessed to be in a position to succeed in many different
disciplines, making the transition from college into the real world extremely
exciting but full of unanswered questions.  My studies here at Notre Dame are
in Electrical Engineering through the College of Engineering and Physics
through the College of Science.  However, my attraction to the practicality,
scalability, and power of programming compelled me to focus on computer science
related projects and interests outside of the classroom.

Sometimes I envy peers that are able to definitively describe the next decade
of their life - a gap year followed by med school and residency; service to our
country through years in the armed forces; a clear calling to graduate school for a certain discipline in which they thrive.  I've been presented with ample opportunity and have considered all of these options ten times over, always arriving at the same conclusion - I would absolutely love all of them.  But eventually I have to choose. 

This is not unlike my selection of a major upon entering college - the choice ultimately came down to an intersection of my interests and the differentiating nature of studying certain STEM disciplines.  Sure, I would enjoy studying Economics or Finance as an undergraduate, and come from a family with a strong business background, but a STEM degree?  Or even two STEM degrees?  Now that opens doors for your career.

But even then I did not narrow anything down.  On paper, it's Electrical Engineering and Physics.  EE is itself an incredibly broad discipline, and according to the [American Institutue of Physics][physics_link] half of Physics undergrads not attending graduate school for Physics enter Law, Medicine, Education, Computer Science, and Business.

I have merely postponed my career selection by selecting the most enabling combination of studies I could find while at Notre Dame.

My thought process towards a career is similar - though I have no idea where my
career is headed, I know my interests will be varied and my passion
for whatever I am doing in the moment will be real and invigorating.  Whatever
I end up doing when I'm 22 years old does not lock me in for life - in fact, I am working towards making sure my job after school can act as a springboard into further career or interdisciplinary success.

On Company Loyalty:
    
I'll likely work for a multitude of companies and perhaps seek to create my own
throughout my career.  Moving between organizations that best align with one's
interests or offer the most enticing reward for work is the very nature of
competition.  This absolutely does not mean there is no such thing as company
loyalty - in fact, loyalty to a company and commitment to it's vision is one of
the best signs of healthy competition.  Compensation for a job is far more than
monetary in nature once a basic need is met, so it is on the employee to seek
out positions in which they will be satisfied and on the company to show loyalty
in return.

I don't have much experience with non-competes but reading Joel Spolsky's
opinions on the matter made me realize the extent to which such forced
agreements can be limiting.  While a company has the right and obligation to
protect itself, clauses preventing poaching and working for competitors seem to
step on the toes of competition.  A loyal company should have loyal employees.
If some choose to leave, let competition run its course, and may the best
company win.
